# PI-ICR analysis

Created on 17 July 2019 for the ISOLTRAP experiment
- V1.1 (24 June 2020): Maximum likelihood estimation was simplified based on SciPy PDF's and the CERN-ROOT6 minimizer via the iminuit package (â†’ great performance)
- V1.2 (20 February 2021): Preparations for scientific publication and iminuit v2 update integration

### Introduction

The following code was written to reconstruct raw Phase-Imaging Ion-Cyclotron-Resonance (PI-ICR) data, to fit PI-ICR position information and calculate a frequency using the patter 1/2 scheme described in Ref. [1] and to determine a frequency ratio between a measurement ion and a reference ion. Additionally, the code allows to analyze isomeric states separated in pattern 2.

### Dependencies

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) (data storage and calculation)
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) (calculation)
* [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/) (PDFs, least squares estimation)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (plotting)
* [configparser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html) (configuration file processing)
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) (Python notebook environment)
* [iminuit](https://iminuit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (CERN-ROOT6 minimizer)

All packages can be fetched using pip:

`pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy configparser jupyter iminuit`

### Installation and usage

The whole analysis code is based on the main jupyter notebook. It can be run locally using Python 3.7+ by installing all dependencies using the `pip` command from the section above. Next, navigate to this package's folder and run `jupyter notebook pi-icr-analysis.ipynb`. Alternatively, the code can be run in the cloud using services like CERN's SWAN platform, Google Colab or Binder (use button on top of this README). The analysis code provides a full set of example data to run the entire analysis and is already set up to do so. If the execution fails in the "Frequency-ratio calculation" section, please modify the line 129 in `bin/freq_ratio.py` to one of the following values: [-10, -1, -0.001, 0.001, 1, 10]. This varys the starting parameters of the frequency ratio fit, which might get stuck for such a small set of (example) data. In case of a real experiment with many more data points, this does not pose any issues. Have fun :-)
